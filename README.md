# Hamburger menu animation plus example of jQuery usage

## About
The project is nothing but a presentation of so-called "hamburger menu" animation, example of which I made. The element is fixed on the right-top corner of the site and it's ready for further events to be added. The animation starts after click by default, but it may be changed just by replacing "active" class in the CSS code with "hover" pseudo-class. As a result we'll obtain an animation triggered with cursor over the menu field.

The project is also a simple example of jQuery library usage. It's handling click event by default though I wrote Vanilla.js code too(commented).
